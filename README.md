# Data Exploration and Cleaning Documentation: Netflix Dataset

This repository contains the code and documentation for the data exploration and cleaning of the Netflix dataset. The main goal of this project is to explore, clean, and enhance the dataset which provides detailed information about shows and movies on Netflix.

## Dataset Source and Overview
The Netflix dataset used in this project was originally designed to analyze the various shows and movies available on Netflix up to a certain year. It includes various attributes such as show ID, title, director, cast, country of production, release date, rating, duration, listed genre, and a description of the show or movie.

## Issues Identified in the Data
During the preliminary data analysis, several issues were identified including:

- Missing Values: Several columns like Director, Cast, and Country had missing values that needed addressing to provide a more complete analysis.
- Duplicate Records: The dataset contained duplicate entries that needed to be removed to ensure the accuracy of analysis.
- Inconsistent Formatting: The Release_Date column was in string format and had to be converted to a datetime object for better manipulation and analysis.

## Tools Used
- Python: For performing data manipulation and cleaning tasks.
- Pandas: For effective data manipulation and handling of the dataset.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing the data which helps in understanding patterns and insights.
- Jupyter Notebook: Used as the development environment which provides an interactive coding interface.

## Data Cleaning Process
The data cleaning process consisted of several key steps:

- Data Understanding: Initial exploration to understand the datasetâ€™s structure and the type of data contained in each column.
- Data Exploration: Using basic statistical summaries and visualization to uncover patterns, anomalies, and correlations between different data points.
- Removing Duplicates: Duplicates were identified and removed to maintain the integrity of the dataset.
- Handling Missing Values: Analyzed the impact of missing values and addressed them by applying appropriate strategies such as filling with mode, mean or removing depending on the context.
- Standardizing Formats: Converted the Release_Date from string type to datetime format to simplify temporal analysis. Ensured consistent formatting across all text and categorical data fields.
- Feature Engineering: Derived new features like Year from the Release_Date to facilitate easier analysis of trends over the years.
- Validation and Quality Checks: Ensured that all the changes were accurately reflected and checked for any anomalies post-cleanup.

## Documentation
Detailed Jupyter notebooks have been provided in the repository documenting each step of the data exploration and cleaning process. Each notebook includes:

- Code: Python code used for each step of the cleaning process.
- Comments: Detailed comments explaining the purpose and logic of each operation.
- Visualizations: Graphs and tables generated to explore the data and confirm the effectiveness of the cleaning steps.
